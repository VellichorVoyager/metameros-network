# Design Notes: Security & Observability Platform (future)

> Status: **Future / exploratory** · Last updated: 2026-06-26

This captures the longer-term direction for evolving Metameros Network from a gateway
admin UI into a **network asset-discovery and baseline-monitoring** tool. It is a
backlog of ideas, not a committed plan. The shipped WAN exposure feature
([docs/shodan-exposure.md](shodan-exposure.md)) is the first slice of this vision.

## Guiding principle

Think in terms of **asset discovery + baseline monitoring**, not "dangerous ports."
The value is in tracking *what is normal* for this network and alerting on *change*,
with enough context that a finding is actionable rather than a raw port number.

LAN-side discovery (everything below except the Shodan/DNS/TLS items) requires a
local scanner component — `nmap`/`arp`/mDNS probing from a host on the LAN. The
portal can't see LAN services through the gateway API alone, and Shodan can only see
public IPs. So the bulk of this is a **separate local collector** feeding the portal,
distinct from the existing read-only gateway proxy.

## The service-inventory model (core idea)

Rather than a flat list of open ports, model each observed service as a record and
track it over time. This is the data model the whole platform should converge on:

| Attribute | Example |
|---|---|
| Device | MacBook Pro |
| Interface | Wi-Fi / Tailscale / USB tether |
| Port / Protocol | 5353 / UDP |
| Service | Bonjour |
| Process | ControlCenter |
| Scope | Loopback / LAN / VPN / Internet |
| First seen / Last seen | timestamps |
| State | Expected / New / Changed / Exposed |
| Risk | Low / Medium / High |
| Recommendation | "Expected on LAN only" |

This scales far better than a port scanner: it gives context, tracks drift, and
turns "port 5555 is open" into "ADB appeared on the Quest, previously unseen — High."

## Monitoring beyond ports

- **Shodan exposure** — already shipped for the gateway's public IP; extend to track
  history and diff over time.
- **Public IP change tracking** — especially valuable on cellular/CGNAT where the
  address rotates; trigger a re-check on change.
- **DNS posture** — watch A/AAAA/MX/TXT/SPF/DKIM/DMARC for owned domains.
- **TLS certificates** — issuance + expiry monitoring (CT-log style).
- **UPnP / NAT-PMP** — detect devices auto-creating port mappings on the gateway.
- **New listeners** — alert when a host starts listening on a previously unused port.
- **mDNS / Bonjour inventory** — what Apple devices and the Quest advertise on the LAN.
- **MAC address inventory** — trusted-device allowlist; flag unknown devices (the
  portal already lists connected clients — this is the alerting layer on top).
- **ARP change detection** — notify when new hardware joins.
- **VPN / overlay state** — Tailscale peers, Cloudflare Tunnel status, WireGuard sessions.
- **Threat-intel enrichment** — optional reputation lookups for public IPs/domains.

## Shodan API extensions (from shodan-python)

Capabilities in the [shodan-python](https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python)
library/CLI not yet used by the portal, all reachable via Shodan's REST API:

- **Exploit search** (`/api/exploits` via exploits.shodan.io) — surface known exploits
  for products/CVEs found during exposure checks.
- **DNS DB** — domain/subdomain enumeration and DNS lookups for owned domains.
- **Streaming firehose** — real-time stream of Monitor alert events (vs. polling),
  to push alerts into the portal live.
- **Bulk host lookups** — efficient multi-IP enrichment if monitoring more than one
  public address.
- **Email notification management** — configure Shodan-side email triggers alongside
  the in-portal alert config already shipped.

## Architecture implications

- A **local collector** (separate process/container) does LAN discovery and writes to
  a small local store (SQLite/JSON), which the portal reads. Keep it optional and
  off by default, consistent with the repo's safe-by-default posture.
- Persist the service-inventory history locally; never ship it off-device without
  explicit opt-in (same redaction discipline as diagnostics export).
- Everything credit-spending or outbound stays gated behind explicit flags, as with
  the existing Shodan phases.
